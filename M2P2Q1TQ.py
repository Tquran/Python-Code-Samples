# This Program asks for the Users name and then greets them by saying "hello _insert name_"
name = str(input("What is your name?: "))
print("Hello", name)
# program works but need to remember that if it sounds simple it is not
# at first I tried to just do "what is your name" but it took me some time to realise I needed str(input())
