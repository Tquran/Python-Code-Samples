# This program arranges the numbers in a list and places them on different lines
myList = [12, 10, 32, 3, 66, 17, 42, 99, 20]
for i in myList:
    print(i)
# When the numbers are put in a list you can use it multiple times
# Found out that when adding code myList pops up and can be added faster by pressing tab
